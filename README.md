Winmine playing bot

----------
See 'MinesweeperPlayer.exe' for compiled executable bot and Winmine executables from Windows XP.

I used Qt framework, it works only with Winmine from Windows XP and earlier, because recognition of images was made only for this graphics.

It doesn't use Winmine hacks or other dodgy techniques. Instead it behaves like human -- sees the playing field and suggests most optimal action based on situation.
